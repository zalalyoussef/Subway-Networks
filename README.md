This project provides a route optimization algorithm for navigating public transportation networks
in major French cities (Paris, Bordeaux, Lille, and Lyon). By calculating the shortest travel time
across metro, tram, and bus lines, the system offers optimal routes between selected stations within
each network. Designed to help new students at an engineering school navigate these cities efficiently,
the application integrates transportation data and applies pathfinding algorithms to enhance user travel experience.
